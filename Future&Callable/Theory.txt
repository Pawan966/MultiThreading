Why Do We Need Futures and Callable?

The Problem:
Java threads (Runnable) have two big limitations:
 - They cannot return a value.
 - They cannot throw checked exceptions.

new Thread(() -> {
// do some computation
int result = 42; // how do we get this back?
}).start();

In real systems (API calls, DB queries, file processing):
 - You need results
 - You need to handle failures
This is where Callable and Future come in.
