# What was wrong with Future?
  Problems:
  ❌ Blocking (get())
  ❌ No chaining
  ❌ No callbacks
  ❌ Hard to combine multiple async tasks

In modern backend systems:
 - You want non-blocking pipelines
 - You want parallel calls + composition
 - You want error handling without blocking threads
👉 CompletableFuture solves this.
